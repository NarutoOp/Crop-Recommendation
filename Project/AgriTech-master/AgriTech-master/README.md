Due to problems with availability of data for each state and unfavourable resulting values during computation (loss instead of profit) approximations have been made or averages have been used in standard.csv and cost-of-cultivation.csv for some crops.


Not to be used as reliable information source due to approximations made in data
Data used is for the period 2000-2007.
